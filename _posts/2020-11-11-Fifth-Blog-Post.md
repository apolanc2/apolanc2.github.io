## Reflection

In my first blog post, I explain how I understood the differences between data scientists and statisticians. I still feel that data scientists are more on the side of predictive analytics and statisticians focus on the analytics of the data set itself. 
Obviously it isn't as simple as this! The two really do go hand and hand. Understanding the modelling from a statistics background is, to me, very important before making any predictions. On the other side, it is becoming increasingly more vital to be able to handle large amounts of data and be prepared with knowledge of multiple programming languages to make the data more useable.
In my second blog post, I mentioned that R was a bit intimidating and shortly after learning a bit of it I started to gain some confidence in it.
Now, as the semester comes to a close I feel even more confident in my abilities with R. I was not aware of the many capabilities R had to offer and I have really enjoyed learning it. 
While I have grown to love R and it's ability to continuously grow each day, I still feel it is important to know more than one program. I will of course continue to use R in the future, but I won't limit myself to just one language!
