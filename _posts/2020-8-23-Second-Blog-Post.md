title: Programming with R
---

In undergrad, I was taught a minimal amount of R. We just learned a few basic statistic functions, but overall it didn't make me feel like I had any type of advantage because of this. When diving into R it can be a bit daunting since there are so many different things to install. I remember when I was first instructed to install R and RStudio, I had no idea what I should be clicking and was a bit overwhelmed. 
Prior to enrolling in the course ST 558 - Data Science for Statisticians, I took the course ST 555 - Statistical Programming I. This course went over the ins and outs of SAS. The main thing I enjoy about SAS was the structure. Since this is a commercial software, we can be sure of the format and structure of each function and it is all installed in one package. While I do like this, I don't think this is by any means a reason to throw R out the window. My first impression of R was a bit intimidating, but I can certainly say I no longer feel this way and don't think of open source software as daunting. Being familiar with programming in a different software made this a possiblity and in the end made it less difficult to learn R. In this process, I found the greatest thing about R is it allows for easy sharing. Both R and SAS are great programs, but I feel it is important to know and understand them both. I'm excited to be able to have learned both softwares.
