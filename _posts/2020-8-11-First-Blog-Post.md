Data scientists are simply data experts. I think we can all agree that they are able to handle large amounts of data with the use of programming tools. In addition to this, they then use algorithims for predictive analytics. Srihari Sasikumar explains the necessary skills to be a data scientist really well (3); to be a great data scientist you'll need be a strong programmer familiar with many languages, experienced with database coding, understand and replicate analytics, and of course understand machine learning.
Data scientists and statisticians are similiar in the sense they both rely on data analytics to draw conlcusions from their data. As of right now, in my opinion data scientists seem to be more on the side of predictive analytics, where statisticians may focus on the analytics of the data set itself. Of course this isn't always the case, but more of the general idea. I think this is why I agree with Open Data Science in that the roles will eventually merge (1).
Currently, I'm a data analyst and after reading more about data science I could see myself progressing into that role of a data scientist. Although, I have always visualized myself to eventually be a research stastician in the healthcare field. Truthfully, I have a lot to think about!
